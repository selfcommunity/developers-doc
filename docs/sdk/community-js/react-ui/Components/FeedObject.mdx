> The Feed Object component renders a post, discussion or status item.<br/>
Every feed object item is composed of a section containing the avatar and username of the author, the item content and the date of creation of the same
(post and discussion type can also contain a related poll).<br/>
There are also various actions that can be performed on these items, such as comment, like and share, which are represented by icons.
Moreover, through the top right menu it is possible to get item's permanent link and to turn notifications off.
