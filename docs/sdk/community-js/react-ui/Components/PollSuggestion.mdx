> The Poll Suggestion component renders a list of suggested polls.<br/>
This list is composed of items containing poll author, title and a "see" button that allows users to browse to the post in which the poll is contained.<br/>
The polls are shown in an orderly manner: few items are shown in the main card while the others can be displayed in a modal card by clicking on the "show all" button.

import PollSuggestion from './pollSuggestion.js';
import Logged from "../../Logged";

<Logged><PollSuggestion/></Logged>

#### Usage

```jsx
 import React from 'react';
 import {SCContextProvider} from '@selfcommunity/react-core';
 import {PollSuggestion} from '@selfcommunity/react-ui';

 function App() {
   const conf = {
     portal: '<community-path>',
     session: {
       type: 'OAuth',
       token: '<community-token>',
       refreshToken: '<community-refresh-token>',
       refreshTokenEndpoint: '<community-refresh-endpoint>',
