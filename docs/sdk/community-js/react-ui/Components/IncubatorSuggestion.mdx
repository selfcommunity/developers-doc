> The Incubator Suggestion component renders a list of suggested incubators.<br/>
This list is composed of items containing incubator's title, info, a subscription status bar and a subscribe button that allows users to subscribe/unsubscribe to an incubator.<br/>
By clicking the incubator title it is possible to open a modal card showing the incubators details and a section where it is possible to share the item on social networks.<br/>
The incubators are shown in an orderly manner: few items are shown in the main card while the others can be displayed in a modal card by clicking on the "show all" button.
