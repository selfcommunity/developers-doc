> The Change Picture component  renders a button that allows users to manage their profile pictures.<br/>
Once clicked, the button opens a modal card where all previously uploaded pictures are shown, and from there <br/>
it is possible to remove old pictures and also add new ones. <br/>
The last picture uploaded, or the selected one becomes the new profile picture.

import ChangePicture from './changePicture.js';
import Logged from "../../Logged";

<Logged><ChangePicture/></Logged>
