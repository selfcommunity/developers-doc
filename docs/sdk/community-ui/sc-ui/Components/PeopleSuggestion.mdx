> The People Suggestion component renders a list of suggested people.<br/>
This list is composed of items containing user's avatar and username, info (or followers counter) and a follow button that allows users to follow/unfollow others.<br/>
The categories are shown in an orderly manner: few items are shown in the main card while the others can be displayed in a modal card by clicking on the "show all" button.

import PeopleSuggestion from './peopleSuggestion.js';
import Logged from "../../Logged";

<Logged><PeopleSuggestion/></Logged>
